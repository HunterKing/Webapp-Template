# Frontend-Template

This is a React-Typescript template created with `create-react-app`, with simple Bootstrap styling, a navigation bar, and a layout with multiple pages for expansibility in the future. This is a simple template for me to use to skeleton out webapps in the future.

## Usage
run `npm install` from the top-level directory, then `npm run start` to start the application.

## Critical Dependencies
* `react`: is React.
* `bootstrap`: The core of bootstrap including it's CSS.
* `bootstrap-react`: The bootstrap package for react.
* `node-fetch`: reqiured for API requests, `/GetPost`.
